git --version

git -init (to make a normal direcftory , a git directory)

git status (to check status of a git repo)

first do staging , then commit.

git add . (all files move from working directory to staging area.)

do commit to save the file

git commit -m "type message here"
always write comjkit messages in  a meaningful way so that other collaboraters can read it and understand it

origin is added to store the code in remote website

    version 1

clear to clear screen


three layer architecture


working area --> staging --> commit




add remote origin line to connect our code to cloud websites

then add ssh fingerprint 
1--->go to github settings -->ssh and fingerprint --> then genetraete new one
it has 3-4 commands
copy paste it in the git and execute that
generate key and copy it and paste it in  github website
and save it.

to push code to website
git push -u origin master

to pull code from website
git pull origin  master (try it)

to see what changes are made in new commit and see the difference betweeeen the commits--
git diff filename
git difff tutorial.txt



git diff --staged tutorial.txt 
to see changes in the staged file

to get back the work to last commit,means rollback
git reset tutorial.txt
git checkout tutorial.txt

git checkout .
this cmd will unstage every file in the dir.


git add -A (stages all)
git add . (stages new and modified files) WITHOUT deleted
git add -u (stages modified and deleted files,without new files)


to clone a directory / to download a repositary from someone elses github account
go to their repositary and go to clone or downlkoad and copy ssh key
then create a folder in computer right clivck and open gitr bash and type git clone and paste that key.
git clone git@github.com:shreesha17/git-tutorial-codewithharry.git (to create new folder and paste files there)
git clone git@github.com:shreesha17/git-tutorial-codewithharry.git . (to paste in same dir)

if there are many files in the repositary , and it it uploades in github .u dont want to track the changes to some files , the size may be large ,orany other reasons ,, then store those filenames in gitignore file in the repo.so that u wont get notified or wont be able to track changes to the files.


by default the branch is master.
if u are modifying some files and it may be damngerous ,or original file mauy be lost or giving access to some othres to work on your files.then create another branch and then merge that branch to master and update code.


to check the avialable branches
git branch

git branch login-system
new login-system named branch gets creatd which contains copy of all files of master branch.

to change the branch
git checkout login-system

to merge changes in login-sytem to master the,
git merge login-system
s
t hen push the code,
git push -u origin master

 
once the branches are merged ,then that branch has redudndent data.
to delete that branch--on local machine
git branch -d login-system

to delete branch on remote loxcation
git push origin --delelte  login-system
